### Summary

I chose 'Astrology' as my topic. The webpage will automatically load a preset list of buttons. When a button is clicked, 12 of the most relevant gifs will populate below. You can animate the gif my clicking on it. 

You can also make your own buttons based on search criteria entered. The button will populate and display 10 gifs based on the search criteria entered.
