### Overview

Homework assignment focusing primarily on APIs and AJAX. 

In this assignment, we were asked to use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs on a topic of our choice. 

Requirements include: calling on the GIFPHY API and using Javascript/jQuery to change the HTML of the site. 

### Summary

I chose 'Astrology' as my topic. The webpage will automatically load a preset list of buttons. When a button is clicked, 10 of the most relevant gifs will populate below. You can animate the gif my clicking on it. 

You can also make your own buttons based on search criteria entered. The button will populate and display 10 gifs based on the search criteria entered.
